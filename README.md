# My Portfolio
Hey there! My name is JayTalaz, I am a Lua.RBX Programmer! If you're reading this, this may be because you're hiring me to do something for you, or you simply are thinking about it.

What you need to know:)
  
  -- I am mostly fond of Gui scripting, I can do other things, but UIs are my main work.
  
  -- I am not a crazy good developer (yet)! I am learning each and every day and getting better as I go!
  
  -- I will try my hardest to complete whatever project you put upon me! If I fail to do so, I will not expect any payment from you.
  
  -- Please be lenient, I try my hardest to do your project as well as possible!
  
  -- Languages I am learning or already speak: Java, JavaScript, Lua, and Python.
  
What you should expect:)

  -- Expect me to do my best! I will try my hardest to deliver to you!
  
  -- Expect me to have a life, I will not be working on your project 24/7 because I have things to do!
  
  -- I am not a maid, I will not do things for you that you can do yourself, I only do what I am hired for.
  
Thank you for choosing me to be your programmer!
